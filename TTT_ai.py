# init ai will define architecture

## ooh this could get hard... was thinking would need to train between moves
# and got scared of processing time
''' actually can learn (train) between games. when click play again or
when click hvr or rvr ... pause where ai "learns from memory"
makes sense since it would n't change weights on current moves since doesn't
know if it will win or lose

train all sets where will
define nueral net archit
    layout archi
learn-from-memo
    will def cost and gradients... octave checks
    will calculate theta weights is critical

ai_move
    then can use fp to predict probablility of a good move
    same for bad move
    good %s - bad %s (only if bads are grt 50? why)
    need catches at 0 prevent negatives

    choose maximum percent move
    return
